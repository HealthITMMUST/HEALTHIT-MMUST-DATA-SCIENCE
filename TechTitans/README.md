### FIFA 21 messy, raw dataset for cleaning
- Convert the height and weight columns to numerical forms
- Remove the unnecessary newline characters from all columns that have them.
- Based on the 'Joined' column, check which players have been playing at a club for more than 10 years!
- 'Value', 'Wage' and "Release Clause' are string columns. Convert them to numbers. For eg, "M" in value column is Million, so multiply the row values by 1,000,000, etc.
- Some columns have 'star' characters. Strip those columns of these stars and make the columns numerical
- Which players are highly valuable but still underpaid (on low wages)? (hint: scatter plot between wage and value)
